I am Hao Zhang (张 浩), ...

**Research interests**
* Causal discovery, causal representation learning, machine learning under a causal perspective.
* Domain adaptation/generalization with a valuable theoretical guarantee. 
* Probabilistic methods: inference, generative models, uncertainty modeling.
* Self-supervised learning and its support theory.
